<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><strong>vandal-equalizer</strong> is a simple audio equalizer programmed with VHDL. Its purpose is to serve as a learning exercise of VHDL, performing some basic digital signal processing tasks such as filtering, level detection or gain adjustment.</p>

<p>The project comprises the implementation of the following modules, each of which can be studied as independent VHDL examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>IIR digital bandpass filters</li>
<li>Gain adjustment for each audio band</li>
<li>Delay module (reverb effect)</li>
<li>Simulated VU meter (level detection)</li>
</ul><p>The project has been developed with <em>ModelSim PE Student Edition 10.1</em>. Although it has not been simulated with any other tool, it should be able to work with any simulation software compatible with VHDL.</p>

<p>The quality of the implemented modules may not meet high performance standards. The purpose of this implementation is exclusively educational, and therefore a proper audio processing ability is not guarranteed.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>I recommend using ModelSim for simulation of this project. A free copy can be obtained from <a href="http://model.com/update/modelsim-downloads">their site</a> as long as it is used for educational purposes.</p>

<p>If you are a student, visit <a href="http://model.com/update/modelsim-downloads">http://model.com/update/modelsim-downloads</a> and get the free copy they offer. There are also many other compatible tools, such as <em>GHDL</em> and <em>GTKWave</em>, which can be used for VHDL simulation.</p>

<p>Download the source files from github:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>git clone https://github.com/Krun/vandal-equalizer.git
</pre></div>

<p>Compile and run the simulation. Testbench files are provided, although they do not provide an exhaustive demonstration of the implemented capabilities.</p>

<h2>FPGA Embedding</h2>

<p>This project has not been made with the purpose of being embedded in FPGA's, and therefore, its implementation is not adequate for its direct embedding.</p>
